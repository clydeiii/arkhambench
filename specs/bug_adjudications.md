Running ledger of agent-filed `./ahlcg bug` reports and their verdicts. Sources of

## fable5-bughunt game-01 (Roland, Return, seed 1001) — 2026-07-04

1. **"Agenda 2 advanced to agenda 3 without spawning the set-aside Ghoul Priest."**
   **NOT A BUG.** The Ghoul Priest spawns from Act 2b "The Barrier" ("Spawn the
   set-aside Ghoul Priest in the Hallway"), not from any agenda. Agenda 2b "Rise of
   the Ghouls" only digs a Ghoul enemy out of the encounter deck/discard. The agent's
   premise (priest via agenda 2b) was mistaken; a game that never advances Act 2
   never sees the priest.

2. **"no_resolution xp 4 but victory display only 2 — expected no resolution bonus."**
   **NOT A BUG.** Campaign guide, The Gathering, "If no resolution was reached":
   each investigator earns Victory X *and* "2 bonus experience as he or she gains
   insight into the hidden world of the Mythos" (and the lead earns Lita). VP 2 +
   2 insight = 4 XP is correct.

Quality note: both reports were specific, checkable, and cited log evidence — the
reporting channel works; the claims just didn't survive the source texts.

## fable5-bughunt game-02 (Daisy, Return, seed 1002) — 2026-07-04

3. **Self-retraction of report 1**: the agent verified in game 2 that Act 2b spawns
   the Ghoul Priest and asked to close its own agenda-spawn claim. Matches
   adjudication (one nuance: the spawn is on Act 2b in core The Gathering as well —
   it never lived on the agenda).

## fable5-bughunt game-03 (Skids, Return, seed 1003) — 2026-07-04

4. **"Elusive offers a move to my current location / with no valid destination."**
   **CONFIRMED BUG — first verified agent find.** `elusive_destinations` did not
   exclude the investigator's own location (RR "Move": an entity cannot move to its
   current placement), and the play was offered even when it could not change the
   game state (no destination, no engaged enemies). Fixed same day: current location
   excluded, option/exec gated on a legal destination or an engaged enemy;
   regression test added (ElusiveDestinationTests). Credit: Fable 5, game 3, R1.
